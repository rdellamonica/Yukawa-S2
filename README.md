## f(R)-gravity after the detection of the orbital precession of the S2 star around the Galactic centre massive black hole

The pipeline used for the computations in the article, contained in the `Yukawa-MCMC.py`, makes use of the [PyGRO](https://github.com/rdellamonica/pigro/tree/master) package that is currently under development.
